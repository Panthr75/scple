# Take a pill out of the bottle

SCP-500 would be useless without this feature. I mean, how useless would it be if you couldn't empty SCP-500.

Anyways, the recipe is very straight-forward.

## recipe
B

## key
B: SCP-500 (Loses durability. If durability reaches 0, then it will return the Pill Bottle)

## output
SCP-500-1 x 1
